#1 Project Domain and Why We Chose It (Revised)
The project weâ€™ve embarked on is called Book Rating Hub, a platform designed to bring book enthusiasts together in a community-focused environment. 
Originally envisioned as a system for trading books, we have since shifted our focus to creating a Book Rating Hub due to time constrains and more. 
This platform now centers on allowing users to explore books, rate and comment on them.


Physical books continue to hold a unique charm in the digital era. They offer a tactile experience that many readers cherish. 
However, discovering and sharing thoughts about books can often be limited to personal networks or small online forums. 
Our thought behind this platform was to bridge this gap by enabling a centralized place for users to explore book reviews, contribute ratings, and participate in a literary community. 



Here is the list of requirements for the current version of our project, structured as user stories:

User Registration
As a user, I want to create an account so that I can log in and participate in the community.

User Login
As a user, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access features such as rating and commenting.

View Available Books
As a user, I want to browse a list of books available on the platform to find titles that interest me.

View Book Details
As a user, I want to view detailed information about a book (e.g., title, author, genre, average rating, comments) so that I can decide whether to engage with it.

Rate a Book
As a user, I want to rate a book to share my opinion and help others make informed decisions.

Comment on a Book
As a user, I want to be able to give an in depth review on a specific book. 

Admin: Remove a Rating or Comment
As an admin, I want to delete inappropriate ratings or comments to ensure a positive user experience.

Reflecting on the Shift in Vision
Initially, the project aimed to enable book trading, focusing on exchanging physical/online books between users. 
However, after analyzing the technical parts and requirements we wanted to implement, we soon realized that the technical aspects of book trading were more complex than anticipated. So with this in mind, we decided to change our focus to a more straightforward and manageable project to our ability. This simpler approach also reduces the complexity of implementation, enabling us to focus more on the quality of the user experience and functionality.
The shift in direction demonstrates our adaptability and commitment to delivering a valuable application, even if it means reevaluating initial ideas.
