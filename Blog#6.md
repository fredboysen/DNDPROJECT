The Book Rating Hub project is complete and fully operational, looking at the requirements. The system has been tested and a video has been made. Throughout the development process, we made sure to follow our requirements, to ensure a user-friendly and feature-rich application as well as to have the program fulfill what we wanted it to
Key development milestones that were finalized include:
- Implementation of user registration, login, and authentication with role-based access control.
- A Functional book rating system, including the ability to view, rate, and comment on books.
- Administrative features for managing books and moderating user-generated content.
- Comprehensive integration between the Blazor frontend and ASP.NET Core backend for seamless interaction.
